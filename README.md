### Getting Started
To access the page, the `project1.html` file can be opened in any browser.

### Using the page
- Upon opening the `project1.html` page, the user can see a page containing some of my personal information and projects. 
- There are many links that can be linked. Those links should normally lead to other pages, which have not been constructed yet. 
- Because the other pages of the website have not been constructed, clicking on the links leads to the `soon.html` file, which shows a page saying "coming soon."
 
### Built with
 - The `html` and `css` file were built by Eyad Alshubber.
